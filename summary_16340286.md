# [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) Project Summary
> Author: [16340286](https://github.com/Ernie1)  

GraphQL was developed to cope with the need for more flexibility and efficiency to design web APIs.  
## [Data Fetching](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/)
With a REST API, you would typically gather the data by accessing multiple endpoints. Secondly, there’s likely to be a `/users/<id>/posts` endpoint that returns all the posts for a user. The third endpoint will then be the `/users/<id>/followers` that returns a list of followers per user.  

In GraphQL on the other hand, you'd simply send a single query to the GraphQL server that includes the concrete data requirements. Intuitively, GraphQL doesn't have the concept of API root.
## [Authorization](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/5-common-questions/)
Authentication in GraphQL can be implemented with common patterns such as [OAuth](https://oauth.net/).  

To implement authorization, it is [recommended](https://graphql.org/learn/authorization/) to delegate any data access logic to the business logic layer and not handle it directly in the GraphQL implementation.
## [Pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/)
GraphQL adopts cursor-based pagination with the coorperation among `connection`, `edges`, `node`, `pageInfo` and `cursor` tags etc.
## [Document GraphQL Schema](https://github.com/exogen/graphql-markdown)
```
 $ npm install graphql-markdown --save-dev
```
Document retrieved from GraphQL syntax file.
```
 $ graphql-markdown swapi/schema.graphql > APIDOC.md
```
## [Build GraphQL Server from GraphQL Schema](https://gqlgen.com/ )
```
 $ cd swapi
```
Initialise dep. This will inspect any imports you have in your project, and pull down the latest tagged release.
```
 $ dep init
```
Create the empty skeleton.
```
 $ go run scripts/gqlgen.go init
```
Run dep ensure, so that we can ensure that the newly generated code’s dependencies are all present.
```
 $ dep ensure
```
## [Build GraphQL Client from GraphQL Schema](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)
Generate code from GraphQL schema with the help of [graphql-code-generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/).
```
 $ cd client
```
Edit the configuration file `codegen.yml`.
```
schema: ../swapi/schema.graphql
overwrite: true
generates:
  client-types.ts:
    - typescript-common
    - typescript-client
```
Run the code-generator using `gql-gen` to generate the output `client-types.ts`.
```
 $ npm install
 $ ./../node_modules/.bin/gql-gen 
```
In order to build a more complete client, you may refer to the [document](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/documents-field) for details.
